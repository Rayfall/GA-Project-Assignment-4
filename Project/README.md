## Project Description

Whether you are a stay-at-home parent, a college student or the CEO of a start-up, there are always tasks that need to be completed. Having a task app helps to alleviate some of the stress or anxiety caused by everyday life. Tasks apps can be used to keep track of meetings, make a grocery list, or just to put down a reminder for later in the day.

With Thrive, however, you are able to share those tasks with friends, family members, or co-workers.  This will help to lessen the burden of completing a task, or decreasing the chances of there being any miscommunication. With Thrive, there is an extra level of control in your day-to-day events.
